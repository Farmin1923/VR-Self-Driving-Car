## VR Based Self-Driving Car


I am developing a VR based self-driving car simulator in Unity 3D for using it as a testing bed for predicting pedestrian intention. 
VR simulators are recognized for their affordability, and adaptability in producing a variety of traffic situations, 
and it is more reliable to conduct human-factor research in autonomous cars. 
I have made a multi-player client-server where the car and the pedestrian input can be controlled from different systems.
Also, animated an avatar and write scripting for synchronizing VR-input action with Unity 3D input.
